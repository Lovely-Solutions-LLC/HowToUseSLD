        <div>
          <h2>Step One</h2>
          <p>
            After you've installed the app and opened up the Status Label
            Directory board view, you will see the name of each status column on
            your board listed out. Click on any of the dropdown arrows to open
            up the labels associated with that column.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2>Step Two</h2>
          <p>
            The first editable field from the left is the notes field. Clicking
            on the circled page icon for a label will open up it's "Notes" page.
          </p>
        </div>
        <img src="assets/two.png" alt="" />
        <img src="assets/three.png" alt="" />
        <div>
          <h2>Step Three</h2>
          <p>
            The "Notes" page provides users with a user-friendly rich text
            editor that allows for detailed and well-organized documentation to
            be compiled.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2>Step Four</h2>
          <p>
            The "Link" field provides users with a space to add links to any
            outside materials associated with a label, such as a Google Doc, or
            Loom video. After entering a link, the user can click on the blue
            "Go" button to immediately be taken to the link that is placed in
            that field.
          </p>
        </div>
        <img src="assets/four.png" alt="" />
        <img src="assets/five.png" alt="" />
        <div>
          <h2>Step Five</h2>
          <p>
            Both the "Last Updated By" field and the "Last Updated" field will
            update automatically based on when, and by who any field in the
            directory is modified.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2>Step Six</h2>
          <p>
            Each label will have a small eye icon to the far right of the view.
            Clicking that icon will hide the label from the list. A use case for
            hiding a label might be if it's a label that doesn't require any
            documentation, so it's better off hidden away and not cluttering the
            list.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once a label for a column is hidden, a new button will appear
            underneath the list of labels for that column that says "Show Hidden
            Labels". Clicking on this will unhide all labels that are hidden for
            this list.
